            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>
                These Terms and Conditions between Optimum
                (&ldquo;Optimum&rdquo;) and the Client (hereafter the
                &ldquo;Agreement&quot;) govern the execution and receipt of the
                Optimum Staking Service (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) provided by
                Optimum to the Client. They apply to all staking services
                provided by Optimum, regardless of which staking service is
                used. Other product or service-specific agreements and other
                special regulations for staking transactions are reserved.
            </p>
            <h2>2. Description of the service</h2>
            <p>
                The Service is a digital asset staking service operated by
                Optimum, where the Client has the ability to deposit ALGO in
                exchange for the OPT token. Deposits are enabled after the
                reward distribution from the previous Governance period and
                prior to end of the sign-up phase for the current Governance
                period (a period that traditionally spans approximately ten
                days). Optimum agrees to grant the Client access to the Service
                pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement
                and the Client agrees to use the Service only in strict
                conformity with such terms and conditions. The Service is an IT
                service, where Optimum operates validators; the Service is not
                an investment service.
            </p>

                Optimum operates the Service in a diligent and professional
                manner in accordance with applicable IT industry standards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Service is a non-custodial service: the Client is
                responsible for maintaining the security of its own accounts and
                private keys at all times. Optimum will never ask for private
                keys in any circumstance. Optimum will not hold any client
                private keys at any moment and will not act as a custodian of
                Client&rsquo;s funds.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Client&rsquo;s responsibilities during the Term of the
                Service
            </p>
            <p>
                The Client will &ldquo;stake&rdquo; and &ldquo;unstake&rdquo;
                ALGO in exchange for OPT token. ALGO can be staked or unstaked
                at the Client&rsquo;s discretion.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>6. Availability of the Service</p>
            <p>
                Optimum will provide the Client with all information necessary
                to use the Service. The Client acknowledges that Optimum is
                making the Service available through the Internet or through
                other means mutually acceptable to the Client and Optimum and
                that access to the Internet and the Service is dependent on
                numerous factors, technologies and systems, all of which are
                beyond the authority and control of Optimum. The Client
                acknowledges and agrees that Optimum shall not be liable or
                responsible for any inability of the Client to access the
                Service due to blockchain and/or computer network issues.
                Optimum will strive to provide the Service or repair any fault
                under its full control, as the case may be, in an appropriate
                and generally accepted manner using the resources available
                during Swiss banking hours and days. The Client acknowledges and
                agrees that Optimum may employ, delegate, engage, associate or
                contract with one or more affiliates, agents or service
                providers as Optimum may deem necessary or desirable to assist
                it in providing the Service or discharging its other obligations
                under this Agreement; provided, however, that Optimum shall be
                as responsible to the Client for the acts and omissions of any
                such affiliates, agents or service providers as it is for its
                own acts and omissions under this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>7. Access to the service; Restrictions on use</p>
            <p>a. Access to the service</p>
            <p>
                This Service is a private service. Access and use of the Service
                is limited to Optimum&rsquo;s Clients only. The Client shall not
                permit any other entity or person to use the Service and the
                Client shall immediately notify Optimum of any unauthorized use
                of the Service.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>b. Certain restrictions on use</p>
            <p>
                The Client is solely responsible for all information and the
                usage that it makes available via the Service. The Client agrees
                that it shall not use the Service (i) in a manner that
                negatively affects other users or interferes with or disrupts
                the Service or that could otherwise bring the Service into
                disrepute; (ii) in any manner that intentionally or
                unintentionally violates any applicable law, regulation or
                sanctions.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                The Client is only authorized to &ldquo;stake&rdquo; its own
                ALGO. IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR THE CLIENT TO
                &ldquo;STAKE&rdquo; ALGO OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES.
            </p>
            <p>c. Acceptable use</p>
            <p>
                The Client may not (a) reverse engineer, dissemble, or decompile
                any part of the Services. The Client shall bear the risk of loss
                for, and assumes all liability arising from, any unauthorized or
                fraudulent usage of Services (or any hardware or software
                component thereof). In addition, Client agrees not to (i) send
                or store malicious code in connection with the Services or
                otherwise interfere with or disrupt performance of the Services,
                (ii) use manual or automated tools to scan or probe the Services
                in order to determine vulnerabilities, or (iii) attempt to gain
                access to the Services or its related systems or networks in a
                manner inconsistent with the permitted use of the Service.
                Optimum reserves the right, but is not required, to take any and
                all action it deems appropriate, including, without limitation,
                blocking access to geographic areas or suspending access to
                Services (or any hardware or software component thereof), in
                order to prevent or terminate any fraud, abuse or illegal use of
                or activities in connection with the Services or any other
                breach of this section, provided, however, that any such action
                by Optimum shall be consistent with applicable laws, rules, and
                regulations.
            </p>
            <p>8. Term; Termination</p>
            <p>
                The Service under this Agreement will start on the date that the
                Client creates an account and agrees to these Terms and
                Conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any or
                no reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon termination of this Agreement, all licenses to access and
                use the Services will likewise terminate, and Client will
                immediately thereafter discontinue all such access and use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any obligations and duties that by their nature extend beyond
                the expiration or termination of this Agreement will survive the
                expiration or termination of this Agreement including, without
                limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality
                obligations, warranty disclaimers, indemnification and
                limitations of liability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon termination, the Client shall (i) cease to use of the
                Service (unstake or undelegate); and (ii) pay to Optimum all
                fees and expenses outstanding through the termination date. Upon
                termination, Optimum shall pay to the Client its attributable
                Staking Rewards minus Optimum fees. Further, the termination of
                this Agreement, for any reason, shall not affect the entitlement
                of Optimum to any fees and expenses due. All representations,
                warranties, and covenants made in or pursuant to this Agreement
                will survive the termination of this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>9. Fees</p>
            <p>
                The Client agrees to pay Optimum the fees set forth on
                Optimum&rsquo;s website. Optimum charges a percentage of the
                Staking Rewards. Fees are non-refundable. The Client explicitly
                authorizes Optimum to deduct and levy fees from the Staking
                Rewards due to the Client. Optimum may increase fees at any
                time. The Client will be notified one (1) month in advance of
                the intention by Optimum to increase such fees.
            </p>
            <p>10. Proprietary information</p>
            <p>
                The Client acknowledges and agrees that Optimum owns and shall
                retain all right, title and interest in and to the Service, all
                components thereof, including without limitation all related

                development data and manufacturing methods, (k) patent and (l)
                other intellectual property and ownership rights, including
                applications for the grant of any of the same, in or to the
                Service and all other related proprietary rights of Optimum
                (together, with any and all enhancements, corrections, bug

                correct, update, transfer, reproduce, republish, broadcast,
                create derivative works based on or otherwise modify, in any
                manner, all or any part of the Service or the Proprietary
                Information. The Client further agrees to keep, the Proprietary
                Information confidential and not to transfer, rent, lease, loan,

            <p>
                Optimum may collect and store information regarding the Client

                software or hardware after Optimum has made available a
                non-infringing alternative to the Client or (v) such damages,
                liabilities, losses, costs or expenses arise as a result of the
                fraud or willful misconduct of the Client.

                Service, except, in each case, to the extent that such damages,
                liabilities, losses, costs and expenses are incurred as a result

            <p>
                Prizes are generated on the interest earned on deposited
                funds.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a deposit is made into Optimum, funds are
                routed to non-custodial accounts which generate interest by
                participating in the Algorand Foundation Governance program. The
                registration and voting process is automated for our users with
                votes aligning with the Algorand Foundation&rsquo;s
                recommendations. &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                A large portion of the ALGO rewards generated from participation
                in Governance is earmarked for the prize pool. Due to the nature
                of the Algorand Governance process, the Governance reward rate
                increases incrementally over the course of each period secondary
                to attrition of reward-eligible accounts. For this reason, the
                prize pool reward rate will always underestimate the true
                Governance reward rate. The difference is distributed equally to
                all participants in the Optimum protocol.&nbsp;

                <strong>How to enter:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The web-based Optimum app is our interface for interacting with
                the smart contract deployed to the Algorand blockchain. Through
                this interface, users have the ability to deposit ALGO in
                exchange for the OPT token. Deposits are enabled after the
                reward distribution from the previous Governance period and
                prior to end of the sign-up phase for the current Governance
                period (a period that traditionally spans approximately ten
                days).&nbsp;&nbsp;Deposits are automatically eligible for weekly
                prizes until withdrawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enter without making a deposit, send a handwritten 3x5 card
                with the words &ldquo;Optimum Sweepstakes Entry&rdquo; printed
                in block letters, your name, email address, and Algorand wallet

            <p>
                Mail-in submissions must be made within the first two weeks of a
                Governance period to be considered valid.

                <strong>Determination of winners:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The winners will be selected at random weekly during each of the
                13 weeks that comprise the Governance period.

                <strong>Odds:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The odds of winning are dependent on individual user OPT balance
                relative to the total OPT distributed by the Optimum smart
                contract. The more ALGO deposited, the higher the odds of
                winning. The exact chance to win changes dynamically relative to
                other users depositing and withdrawing. Individuals submitting a
                mail-in entry shall be treated as if depositing 10 ALGO.

                <strong>Prizes:</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
                The prize pool will be determined at the beginning of every week
                of a Governance period (13 weeks total). This will be determined
                by evaluating the current Governance period APR, which will be
                obtained from data posted on the Algorand Foundation Governance
                website.
