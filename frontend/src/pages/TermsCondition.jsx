     The Service is a digital asset staking service operated by Optimum, where the Client has the ability to deposit ALGO in exchange for the OPT token. Deposits are enabled after the reward distribution from the previous Governance period and prior to end of the sign-up phase for the current Governance period (a period that traditionally spans approximately ten days). Optimum agrees to grant the Client access to the Service pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Client agrees to use the Service only in strict conformity with such terms and conditions. The Service is an IT service, where Optimum operates validators; the Service is not an investment service.

Employees of Optimum, and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders and employees (collectively, “Releasees”), and each of their immediate family members (spouse and parents, children and siblings, and their respective spouses, regardless of where they live) and individuals living in the same households of each of these individuals, whether related or not, of the above are not eligible to enter or win.

<SmallHeading title={"Sweepstakes Giveaway"}/>
<HomePara classes={"text-[#8C7998] font-[400]"}>
Prizes are generated on the interest earned on deposited funds. When a deposit is made into Optimum, funds are routed to non-custodial accounts which generate interest by participating in the Algorand Foundation Governance program. The registration and voting process is automated for our users with votes aligning with the Algorand Foundation’s recommendations. <br />
<br />
A large portion of the ALGO rewards generated from participation in Governance is earmarked for the prize pool. Due to the nature of the Algorand Governance process, the Governance reward rate increases incrementally over the course of each period secondary to attrition of reward-eligible accounts. For this reason, the prize pool reward rate will always underestimate the true Governance reward rate. The difference is distributed equally to all participants in the Optimum protocol.

<SmallHeading title={"How to enter:"}/>
<HomePara classes={"text-[#8C7998] font-[400]"}>
The web-based Optimum app is our interface for interacting with the smart contract deployed to the Algorand blockchain. Through this interface, users have the ability to deposit ALGO in exchange for the OPT token. Deposits are enabled after the reward distribution from the previous Governance period and prior to end of the sign-up phase for the current Governance period (a period that traditionally spans approximately ten days). Deposits are automatically eligible for weekly prizes until withdrawn.
<br />
To enter without making a deposit, send a handwritten 3x5 card with the words “Optimum Sweepstakes Entry” printed in block letters, your name, email address, and Algorand wallet address to:<br />
810 N Main St. #250<br />
Spearfish, SD 57783<br />
Mail-in submissions must be made within the first two weeks of a Governance period to be considered valid.

The odds of winning are dependent on individual user OPT balance relative to the total OPT distributed by the Optimum smart contract. The more ALGO deposited, the higher the odds of winning. The exact chance to win changes dynamically relative to other users depositing and withdrawing. Individuals submitting a mail-in entry shall be treated as if depositing 10 ALGO.
