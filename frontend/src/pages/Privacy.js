                . We are legally obligated to verify your identity when you
                submit a request. We may request additional information from
                you, like your date of birth or a personal identification
                number, to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your
                identity, we may deny your request. If you submit a request to
                delete your personal information, you will also be required to
                confirm the deletion request by email.&nbsp;

                You may designate an authorized agent to make a request under
                the CCPA on your behalf. Your authorized agent must submit proof
                that you have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to
                Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We may deny a request from a
                purported authorized agent who does not provide proof of
                authorization to act on your behalf.&nbsp;

            <p>
                Please understand that we are not obligated to provide you with
                access to your personal information more than twice in a
                12-month period.&nbsp;

            <p>
                If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may
                either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request
                in which case we will notify you of the reason for refusing the
                request.
